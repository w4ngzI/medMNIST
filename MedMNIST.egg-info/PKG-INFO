        We present *MedMNIST*, a collection of 10 pre-processed medical open datasets. MedMNIST is standardized to perform classification tasks on lightweight 28 × 28 images, which requires no background knowledge. Covering the primary data modalities in medical image analysis, it is diverse on data scale (from 100 to 100,000) and tasks (binary/multi-class, ordinal regression and multi-label). MedMNIST could be used for educational purpose, rapid prototyping, multi-modal machine learning or AutoML in medical image analysis. Moreover, MedMNIST Classification Decathlon is designed to benchmark AutoML algorithms on all 10 datasets.

        # Key Features
        * ***Educational***: Our multi-modal data, from multiple open medical image datasets with Creative Commons (CC) Licenses, is easy to use for educational purpose.
        * ***Standardized***: Data is pre-processed into same format, which requires no background knowledge for users.
        * ***Diverse***: The multi-modal datasets covers diverse data scales (from 100 to 100,000) and tasks (binary/multiclass, ordinal regression and multi-label).
        * ***Lightweight***: The small size of 28 × 28 is friendly for rapid prototyping and experimenting multi-modal machine learning and AutoML algorithms.
        
        Please note that this dataset is **NOT** intended for clinical use.
        
        # Code Structure
        * [`medmnist/`](medmnist/):
            * [`dataset.py`](medmnist/dataset.py): PyTorch datasets and dataloaders of MedMNIST.
            * [`models.py`](medmnist/models.py): *ResNet-18* and *ResNet-50* models.
            * [`evaluator.py`](medmnist/evaluator.py): Standardized evaluation functions.
            * [`info.py`](medmnist/info.py): Dataset information `dict` for each subset of MedMNIST.
        * [`train.py`](train.py): The training and evaluation script to reproduce the baseline results in the paper.
        * [`getting_started.ipynb`](getting_started.ipynb): Explore the MedMNIST dataset with jupyter notebook. It is **ONLY** intended for a quick exploration, i.e., it does not provide full training and evaluation functionalities (please refer to [`train.py`](train.py) instead). 
        * [`setup.py`](setup.py): The script to install medmnist as a module
        
        # Requirements
        The code requires only common Python environments for machine learning; Basicially, it was tested with
        * Python 3 (Anaconda 3.6.3 specifically)
        * PyTorch\==0.3.1
        * numpy\==1.18.5, pandas\==0.25.3, scikit-learn\==0.22.2, tqdm
        
        Higher (or lower) versions should also work (perhaps with minor modifications).
        
        
        # Dataset
        
        You could download the dataset(s) via the following free accesses:
        
        * [zenodo.org](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4269852) (recommended): You could also use our code to download the datasets from zenodo.org automatically.
        * [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tl_SP-ffDQg-jDG_EWPlWKgZTmGbvFXU?usp=sharing)
        * [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1bgPbESbLOlUSu4QC-4O46g) (code: gx6i)
        
        The dataset contains ten subsets, and each subset (e.g., `pathmnist.npz`) is comprised of `train_images`, `train_labels`, `val_images`, `val_labels`, `test_images` and `test_labels`.
        
        # How to run the experiments
        
        * Download the dataset manually or automatically (by setting `download=True` in [`dataset.py`](medmnist/dataset.py)).
        
        * [optional] Install medmnist as a module by using command `python setup.py install`
        
        * Run the demo code [`train.py`](./train.py) script in terminal. 
        
          First, change directory to where [`train.py`](./train.py) locates. Then, use command `python train.py --data_name xxxmnist --input_root input --output_root output --num_epoch 100 --download True` to run the experiments, where `xxxmnist` is subset of our MedMNIST (e.g., `pathmnist`), `input` is the path of the data files, `output` is the folder to save the results, `num_epoch` is the number of epochs of training, and `download` is the bool value whether download the dataset. 
          
          For instance, to run PathMNIST
          
              python train.py --data_name pathmnist --input_root <path/to/input/folder> --output_root <path/to/output/folder> --num_epoch 100 --download True
